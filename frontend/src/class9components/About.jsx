          We offer a comprehensive class 9 science and social science course
          based on the National Council of Educational Research and Training
          (NCERT) curriculum. In science, students will explore topics such as
          matter, atoms, and the fundamental unit of life, building a strong
          foundation in the fundamental concepts of physics, chemistry, and
          biology.

          Our NCERT-aligned course is designed to provide an engaging and
          interactive learning experience for students. Our experienced
          educators have developed engaging lessons and activities that are
          aligned with the latest educational standards. Students will have
          access to a range of multimedia resources and assessments to reinforce
          their learning, and can explore science and social science concepts at
          their own pace, with access to our learning platform anytime and
          anywhere. We believe that our NCERT-based course will provide students
          with the knowledge and skills they need to excel in their academic
          pursuits and beyond.
